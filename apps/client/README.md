# OlympusDAO Treasury Subgraph Client

This package contains code generated from the [OlympusDAO Treasury Subgraph](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/treasury-subgraph) repository. Its purpose is to enable the [olympus-frontend](https://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-frontend/) to easily access data in the API server.

## Developer Tasks

As the repository is composed of entirely generated code, none of it is committed into version control.

### Building

To build, run `yarn build` in the root directory.
